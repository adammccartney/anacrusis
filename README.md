Some fun with exploring decoupled architectures as a way to understand
serialization techniques. Goal is to create a very simple visualization that
sends serialized about the animation to a sound server, which produces
synthesized sounds as a result.


### Usage

#### Start the visualizer

```
./bin/start.sh
```
